What do these options actually do, in detail?
Auto Clicking Options
Option	Description
Autoclick	Simulates clicking the big cookie automatically. Value sets clicks per second (e.g., 250 for web, up to 1000 for fast Steam PCs). Increase until issues appear, then lower. May prevent manual wrinkler popping.
Autofrenzy	Like Autoclick, but only during click frenzies. Allows higher value if system can't handle high-speed Autoclick always.
Autoclick GC	Automatically clicks all golden and wrath cookies as soon as they appear.
Autoclick Reindeer	Instantly clicks reindeer when they appear.
Auto Fortune	Instantly clicks fortunes in the news ticker. Consider disabling during active play, as some fortunes are best saved for later.
Auto Buying Options
Option	Description
Autobuy	Automates all purchases except upgrades in the vault or buildings above set limits. Blacklists/research may pause purchases for optimal play.
Other Upgrades	Buys upgrades that don’t directly boost CpS (which Autobuy would otherwise skip).
Auto Blacklist	Disables the selected blacklist once its goal is achieved.
Blacklist	Choose restrictions for Speedrun/Hardcore achievements, Grandmapocalypse, or to block all building purchases.
Mine/Factory Limit	Caps mines/factories (used by Auto-Godzamok). Recommended: ~500 for mid-game, 800+ for late game (factories usually 50–100 less than mines).
Pastemode	Ignores efficiency and buys as many buildings as possible. Not recommended.
Other Automation Options
Option	Description
Auto Bulkbuy	Sets bulk buy mode after ascending (does not persist after reload).
Auto Buy All Upgrades	Repeatedly buys all upgrades until at least one prestige level is earned.
Auto-ascend	Automatically ascends when reaching a set number of new HCs or when prestige doubles.
Ascending during combo	Prevents auto-ascend during large combos (above minimum Frenzy).
Autopop Wrinklers	Pops wrinklers automatically, except during Halloween/Easter if you still need event drops.
Save Shiny Wrinklers	Protects shiny wrinklers from being popped and prevents ending the Grandmapocalypse.
Autoharvest Sugar Lump	Harvests ripe sugar lumps automatically, with optional Rigidel swap for early harvest.
Auto-Dragon's Curve	Swaps to Dragon's Curve aura (and optionally Reality Bending) when harvesting lumps for a higher chance of unusual lumps.
Sugar Baking Guard	Prevents automated lump spending if it would drop your lump count below 100 (to preserve Sugar Baking bonus).
Auto-Golden Switch	Toggles Golden Switch on for click frenzies and off afterward.
Auto-Godzamok	Sells mines/factories during click frenzies if Godzamok is slotted, then rebuys up to the cap.
Auto-Banking	Upgrades bank office level as soon as possible.
Auto-Broker	Hires stock brokers if the next Autobuy is a building and funds allow.
Auto-Loans	Takes loans automatically during click frenzies if certain conditions are met.
Pantheon Options
Option	Description
Auto Pantheon	Automatically slots selected gods. If a god is set for multiple slots, only the highest slot is used.
Auto-Cyclius	Periodically swaps Cyclius between slots for maximum bonus. Works best if other Pantheon slots are filled with different gods. If Supreme Intellect aura is active, uses a modified schedule.
Grimoire Options
Option	Description
Wizard Tower Cap	Sets a mana cap for spellcasting. 37 is best for single FTHOF casting; 81–100 for double casting. Values above 100 waste mana and time.
Auto Cast / Double Cast FTHOF / 100% Consistency Combo	Choose one auto-casting method (see details elsewhere in the README). Only the lowest enabled option is active.
Auto Sugar Frenzy	Buys Sugar Frenzy with a lump during the first big combo of an ascension (if you have 101+ lumps and Sugar Baking Guard is active). You can set a minimum frenzy threshold.
Auto Sweet	Experimental: rapidly ascends and casts spells to farm sugar lumps. Only disable via console. Do not use unless you know how.
Dragon Options
Option	Description
Dragon Upgrading	Buys dragon upgrades as soon as possible, ignoring chains.
Dragon Petting	Rapidly pets the dragon until all drops are unlocked for the ascension.
Dragon Auras	Sets desired auras in order (Aura 1 in slot 1, Aura 2 in slot 2).
Auto Dragon Orbs	If Dragon Orbs aura is active and Godzamok is not slotted, repeatedly sells Yous to spawn golden cookies.
You Limit	Caps the number of Yous bought to avoid losing all cookies to Auto Dragon Orbs.
Season Options
Option	Description
Default Season	Sets the default season if all drops from other seasons are unlocked. Disables Auto-Buy to avoid overpaying.
Free Season	Overrides Default Season to stay in the base season (Christmas/Business Day or all seasons).
Auto-Easter Switch	Switches to Easter during Cookie Storms if you still need eggs.
Auto-Halloween Switch	Switches to Halloween if you still need spooky biscuits and wrinklers are present.
Bank Options
All bank options add a reserve to the next Autobuy purchase, so you never drop below the set amount. The highest active bank is used.

Option	Description
SE Bank	Keeps half the cost of your most expensive building in reserve (always on if auto-casting SE).
Harvesting bank	Keeps enough cookies in reserve to maximize plant harvests (e.g., Bakeberries).
Harvesting during CpS multiplier	Increases the harvesting bank if you want to harvest during frenzies or other multipliers.

• SCIENTIFIC: scientific notation (e.g., 6.3e12)
Infobox	Shows next purchase and active frenzies in the milk window (as text, graphics, or both).
Logging	Logs mod actions to the console (except Autobuy purchases). Disabling may improve performance.
Purchase Log	Logs every purchase and resulting CpS.
Frame Rate	Adjusts the game’s speed.
Tracking	Tracks stats over time for graphing. May slow the game or use lots of memory if left on.
Recommended	Sets all options to recommended defaults for mid/late game. Forces a save and reload. Warning: Resets all options.
Auto Cast and Combos
Frozen Cookies offers several ways to automate spell casting in the Grimoire minigame. The available methods range from simple auto-casting to advanced combos that maximize cookie gains. Combo methods always take priority over simpler auto-cast options.

General Spellcasting Logic:

If the next spell is 'Sweet' (free Sugar Lump), Frozen Cookies will always cast Force the Hand of Fate (FTHOF) next, if you have enough mana.
If the next spell is Clot or Ruin cookies and you are under a timed debuff (like Clot), it will cast Stretch Time to shorten the debuff.
If the next spell is Clot or Ruin cookies and you are not under a timed debuff, it will cast Haggler's Charm instead, to avoid a negative effect.
If a Golden Cookie is on screen and the next FTHOF spell is a backfire, it will wait until the cookie is clicked or expires before casting.
Auto Cast Options
Conjure Baked Goods: Automatically casts Conjure Baked Goods whenever possible.

Force the Hand of Fate (Simple): Casts FTHOF as soon as you have enough mana. If a minimum Frenzy is set, it waits for that Frenzy before casting.

Force the Hand of Fate (Smart): Like the simple method, but with extra logic:

If the next spell is Click Frenzy, it waits for a Frenzy or Dragon Harvest (plus a Building Special) to be active for the full duration.
If Reaper of Fields aura is active, both Frenzy and Dragon Harvest must be active.
If the next spell is Elder Frenzy or Cursed Finger, it waits for a Click Frenzy or Dragonflight to be active for the full duration.
FTHOF (Click and Building Specials Only): Like the smart method, but only casts when the next spell is a Click or Building Special. All other spells are replaced with Haggler's Charm.

Spontaneous Edifice: Sells one You, then casts Spontaneous Edifice to try for a free building. Not useful after 400+ of each building.

Haggler's Charm: Always casts Haggler's Charm, regardless of outcome. Useful for rapid spell casting.

Combo Options
Double Cast FTHOF: Replaces all other auto-cast methods. Looks for a combo of click frenzies and building specials, then double-casts FTHOF for a huge boost. If no combo is available, casts Haggler's Charm instead.

Possible combos include:

Stored Click Frenzy and Elder Frenzy plus a natural Frenzy or Dragon Harvest and a Building Special.
Stored Click Frenzy and a Building Special plus a natural Frenzy or Dragon Harvest and another Building Special.
Two stored Building Specials plus a natural Frenzy or Dragon Harvest and any click frenzy (Click Frenzy, Dragonflight, or Elder Frenzy).
With Reaper of Fields aura, both Frenzy and Dragon Harvest must be active.
Mana requirements for double casting (by Wizard Tower level):

Level 1–4: 81 mana
Level 5: 83 mana
Level 6: 88 mana
Level 7: 91 mana
Level 8: 93 mana
Level 9: 96 mana
Level 10: 98 mana
Setting max mana to 100 is recommended for all levels. Never upgrade Wizard Towers beyond level 10 for this combo.

100% Consistency Combo: An advanced endgame combo that automates the FTHOF double cast and adds extra steps for maximum effect. Requires:

Wizard Towers at level 10 with at least 98 max mana
At least 1 sugar lump (101+ recommended for Sugar Baking bonus)
Fully upgraded dragon (two aura slots)
At least 1 god swap, or Godzamok in Diamond and Mokalsium in Ruby
Whiskerblooms unlocked in the garden (all plants will be harvested, including Juicy Queenbeets)
For best results, disable mine and factory caps in Frozen Cookies settings. While active, the combo will ignore wrath cookies (they are likely to be clots).

Reference: 100% Consistency combo details

Auto Sweet
Not a spell combo, but an experimental feature. When enabled, Auto Sweet will repeatedly ascend until a grimoire seed with 'Sweet' (free Sugar Lump) appears in the first 10 spells, then cast Haggler's Charm until Sweet is cast. It then disables itself.

Warning: Once Auto Sweet is enabled, it can only be turned off in the browser console with the following code:

FrozenCookies.autosweet = 0
It will auto-disable after casting Sweet. Note: On Steam, there is no way to disable Auto Sweet once enabled except by waiting for it to finish.

Efficiency: What Does It Mean?
Frozen Cookies uses a custom efficiency formula to decide what your next optimal purchase should be. The goal is to maximize your progress by balancing cost and the resulting increase in cookies per second (CpS).

The current efficiency formula is:


                     cost    cost
Efficiency = 1.15 \* ----- + -----
                     CpS     ΔCpS

Where:

cost = price of the item (building or upgrade)
CpS = your current cookies per second
ΔCpS = the increase in CpS from the purchase
This formula is based on the idea that, given two possible purchases (A and B), purchase A is better if:


a.cost    b.cost        b.cost    a.cost
------- + ----------- < ------- + -----------
CpS       a.CpS+CpS     CpS       b.CpS+CpS

Originally, the formula was simply (cost/CpS + cost/ΔCpS). However, after extensive simulations (thanks to Vandalite), it was found that multiplying the first term by 1.15 slightly improves long-term efficiency.

For Golden Cookies, a simpler cost/ΔCpS formula is used to determine when to start saving up a "bank" for Lucky payouts, since building up the bank itself increases your effective CpS over time.

These formulas may be updated if better algorithms are discovered. There is also ongoing work to simplify efficiency values into easy-to-understand percentages for users.

Comparison chart: Cookie Monster uses the simpler (cost/ΔCpS) formula, which is less efficient than either Frozen Cookies method.

Information about Frozen Cookies Data
This section explains the data shown in the Frozen Cookies menu:

Autobuy Information
Next Purchase: The item (building or upgrade) that Frozen Cookies recommends as your next optimal purchase. If autobuy is enabled, this is what will be bought next.
Building Chain to: Shown only if the optimal purchase is an upgrade with unmet prerequisites. This displays the final upgrade, while "Next Purchase" shows the prerequisite to buy first.
Time until completion: How long it will take, at your current CpS (cookies per second), to afford the Next Purchase. This includes any required Golden Cookie bank.
Time until chain completion: If building toward a chain, this shows the time needed to buy all prerequisites and the target upgrade.
Cost: The price of the Next Purchase.
Golden Cookie Bank: The amount of cookies Frozen Cookies recommends keeping on hand to maximize Golden Cookie rewards.
Base Δ CpS: The raw increase in displayed CpS from the Next Purchase, including all bonuses.
Full Δ CpS: The estimated effective CpS increase, combining the Base Δ CpS and the change in Golden Cookie value.
Purchase Efficiency: The calculated efficiency of the Next Purchase, based on Frozen Cookies’ formula. This may look worse for chains until all prerequisites are bought.
Chain Efficiency: The efficiency of the entire chain (if applicable). Note: This does not account for CpS increases from buying prerequisites, so it may underestimate true efficiency.
Golden Cookie Efficiency: The efficiency of saving a bank of 10× the maximum Golden Cookie value, to maximize gains from Golden Cookie clicks.
Golden Cookie Information
Current Average Cookie Value: The average value of Golden Cookies with your current CpS, bank, and upgrades. If this is at its maximum, it will be marked as (Max).
Max Lucky Cookie Value: The highest possible value from a Lucky! Golden Cookie, based on your upgrades (typically 8400× CpS with Get Lucky, or 1200× CpS without).
Cookie Bank Required for Max Lucky: The number of cookies you need to have on hand to get the maximum Lucky! payout (Max Lucky Cookie Value × 10).
Estimated Cookie CpS: An estimate of the effective CpS you’d gain by clicking every Golden Cookie. If Autoclick GC is off, this will be 0.
Golden Cookie Clicks: The total number of Golden Cookies you’ve clicked.
Missed Golden Cookie Clicks: The number of Golden Cookies that appeared but were not clicked before disappearing.
Last Golden Cookie Effect: The internal name of the last Golden Cookie effect you received.
Total Recorded Frenzy Time: The total time (while Frozen Cookies was loaded) spent in a Frenzy.
Total Recorded Non-Frenzy Time: The total time (while Frozen Cookies was loaded) spent not in a Frenzy.
Heavenly Chips Information
HC Now: The number of Heavenly Chips you currently own.
HC After Reset: The number of Heavenly Chips you would have if you reset now.
Cookies to next HC: The number of cookies needed to earn one more Heavenly Chip after reset.
Estimated time to next HC: How long it will take, at your current CpS, to earn another Heavenly Chip after reset.
Time since last HC: How long it has been since you last gained a Heavenly Chip.
Time to get last HC: The actual time it took to earn your most recent Heavenly Chip (including bonuses and frenzies).
Average HC Gain/hr: Your average rate of earning Heavenly Chips per hour since the last reset.
Previous Average HC Gain/hr: The average rate for the previous Heavenly Chip, for comparison.
Other Information
Base CpS: Your CpS when no Frenzy is active. Marked with (*) if this is your current CpS.
Frenzy CpS: Your CpS during a Frenzy. Marked with (*) if this is your current CpS.
Estimated Effective CpS: An estimate of your average CpS over time, including Golden Cookie effects. If Autoclick GC is off, this matches Base CpS.
Game Started: Time since your most recent reset.
Internal Information
This table lists every purchase Frozen Cookies is currently considering.

Efficiency: The calculated efficiency value for each purchase. If Δ CpS is negative, this will be Infinity. Lower numbers are better.
Cost: The price of the purchase or the total cost for a chain.
Δ CpS: The total CpS change from the purchase, including estimated changes from Golden Cookies. This can be negative for some upgrades (like Elder Covenant).
